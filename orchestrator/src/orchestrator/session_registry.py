"""orchestrator.session_registry — durable session-registry substrate (Attention Rail T3).

PRD: plans/session-attention-rail-prd.md T3 (spine root; §4.1-4.2, §4.8, §6 G5).

This module is the shared, versioned contract for the global, cross-project
session registry at ``~/.claude/fleet/sessions/<slug>/record.json``. It is
deliberately stdlib-only and self-contained (no intra-orchestrator imports)
so it can be:

- invoked directly by ``skills/spawn/spawn-claude.sh`` via an absolute path
  (no venv/PYTHONPATH/install required), and
- imported as ``orchestrator.session_registry`` by downstream Python
  consumers (T4 verify, T5 result, T6 hooks, T7 leases).

Consumers import the schema/contract defined here; they never re-derive the
record shape (PRD §6 G5).
