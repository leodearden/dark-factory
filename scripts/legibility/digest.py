"""Deterministic confusion-digest extractor (zero LLM).

Turns a single Claude Code session transcript JSONL file into a 5-15KB
markdown digest with YAML frontmatter: one section per confusion-signal
class (non-sidechain user turns, tool-error neighborhoods, self-corrections,
retry loops), plus a handful of scalar signal counts (not-found, df-guard
trips, interrupts).

Task alpha of the confusion-reduction PRD (plans/confusion-reduction-prd.md
Sec 5.1, contract Sec 7.2, boundary test Sec 8.1 producer side). A rewrite
of the agent-legibility survey's ephemeral scorer logic, properly, with
tests -- not a port of survey hacks.

Pure-function core + a thin `main(argv) -> int` argparse CLI, mirroring the
scripts/analyze_speculation_depth.py convention: every function below is
unit-testable against in-memory record lists (no clock, no network).
Malformed JSONL lines degrade (skip) rather than raise -- real transcripts
are written fire-and-forget and can have a truncated/corrupt trailing line.
