"""Measure the plural-enumeration snapshot path's recall against the live corpus.

Task 3949. The question, inherited from task 3079's recall finding: what
does ``_enumeration_is_prepositional_complement`` actually COST on the real
Graphiti edge corpus?

The guard exists to stop the plural path selecting an enumeration that is a
preposition's complement rather than the copula's subject ('Reviews of tasks
1020 and 1030 are pending.' describes the REVIEWS, not the tasks). Its known
cost is that an ordinary sentence-initial adverbial preamble — a date stamp,
a location, a cycle scope — shares the clause with its own preposition and
so suppresses a genuine snapshot behind it ('As of 2026-08-09, tasks 1020
and 1030 are pending.'). Task 3079 declined to tighten the guard on
speculation and asked for a measurement first. This is that measurement.

Read-only. It enumerates valid edges and classifies their fact text; it
never writes to the corpus it measures.

WHY THIS IS A COMMITTED SCRIPT AND NOT A TRANSCRIPT
'Zero matches today' is a point-in-time fact about a corpus that grows every
cycle, so the verdict is only as good as its re-checkability. Following
census_memory_metadata.py's precedent: a report that exists only on an
operator's disk cannot be cited.

COUNTING RULE (why the fields are not required to sum). A fact counts
  - once toward ``regex_matched``      if >= 1 of its matches matched,
  - once toward ``guard_rejected``     if >= 1 of its matches is rejected,
  - once toward ``selected``           if >= 1 of its matches survives.
A fact carrying two enumerations, one governed by a preposition and one not,
is therefore counted in BOTH guard_rejected and selected. The counts are
per-FACT because the reportable unit is 'edges whose retirement this guard
changes', not 'regex spans'.

``lexical_precondition`` counts facts matching this module's own
``_LEXICAL_PRECONDITION_RE`` (``\\btasks\\b\\s*#?\\s*\\d``) — the necessary
prefix of PLURAL_ENUM_SNAPSHOT_RE, and nothing more. Its purpose is to
separate two very different zeroes: 'the corpus contains no plural-task
shapes at all' (nothing to measure) from 'the corpus contains them and the
guard is eating them' (a real recall cost). Without it a headline zero is
uninterpretable.
