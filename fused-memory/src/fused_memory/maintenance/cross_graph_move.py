"""Cross-graph entity move + foreign-duplicate-merge primitives (CGL-ε, task 2271).

Delivers the cross-graph re-key/move primitive that does not exist anywhere
else in this codebase today: ``GraphitiBackend.merge_entities``
(backends/graphiti_client.py:1013) only merges nodes within a single graph,
and ``scripts/purge_knowlive_namespace.py``'s docstring states outright that
there is no clean re-key/cross-graph-move primitive to re-home orphaned data.

Validated approach (``plans/cross-graph-entity-leak-rca.md`` §6 Phase 1,
RCA-validated 2026-07-06 experiment): FalkorDB's decoded/textual float form
for a ``vecf32`` property truncates to 6 decimal places and is LOSSY. Reading
via the raw ``GRAPH.RO_QUERY ... --compact`` transport instead yields the
EXACT float32 decimal string as it exists on the wire. This module therefore
never calls ``float()`` on a vector component -- embeddings are carried as
opaque strings from read straight through to the recreated node/edge's
``vecf32([...])`` Cypher literal (see ``parse_compact_vector_reply`` /
``format_vecf32_literal``).

Scope (Phase-1 foundation only, per ``plans/cross-graph-entity-leak-prd.md``
contract seams S5+S6): primitives only -- no CLI/``run_*`` entrypoint, no
live-data run. Consumed by the migration (ζ) and consolidation (θ) scripts,
which are separate tasks. Byte-fidelity against a REAL FalkorDB is
deliberately NOT asserted by this module's test suite (mock-only, per
project convention) -- that is mandated in the η live throwaway-graph
rehearsal (PRD decision 5).

All Cypher and the raw-embedding transport live in this module (reached via
``graphiti._graph_for(name)`` and ``graphiti._require_falkor_client()``)
rather than as new ``GraphitiBackend`` methods, to avoid file-lock
contention with the γ/W6 normalization work landing in graphiti_client.py
concurrently (PRD G4).
